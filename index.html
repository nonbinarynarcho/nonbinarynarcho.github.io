    <h1 class="wid">Ashe Leigh Cooper's personal website.</h1>
    <p class="wid">This is my <i>motherfucking</i> website.  And it's better 
    than your website.  My pronouns are she/her.</p>
     <h2 class="wid">What do you do?</h2>
     <p class="wid">I code in lua, c, and just recently javascript, though I'm 
     not quite good at that yet.  I'm currently working on some interactive 
     fiction in javascript to help me learn the language.  I also write
     (poorly) @ <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/gendernihilism"> 
     fanfiction.net</a> and you can find me wasting my time and yours 
     <a href="https://www.twitter.com/nonbinarynarcho"> on twitter.</a></p>
     <h2 class="wid">Who are you?</h2>
     <p class="wid">My name is Ashe Leigh Gwendolyn Amelia Octavia Winry Sypha 
     Cooper and my politics are that straight men who look at me should only see
     a pixellated blur.</p>
     <h2 class="wid">What do you like?</h2>
     <p class="wid">I'm a big fan of girls, just... wow, <i>girls</i>, y'know?
     </p>
     <h2 class="wid">What don't you like?</h2>
     <p class="wid">Oh, loads of things, mainly capitalism, america, straight 
     people, and fascism</p>
     <h2 class="wid"> What do you believe? </h2>
     <p class="wid"> I'm so very glad you asked.</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Trans women don't listen to trans men enough, and we need to, as
        a class of people, do far better at it.</li>
        <li>Support of Stalin is antisemitism.</li>
        <li>Support of Israel is antisemitism.</li>
        <li>Antisemitism, in general, is a problem in the left insofar as
        it's a problem in every group of people.  We are not immune to
        bigotry.</li>
        <li>Anarchy is an action, not an identity.  Don't call me an
        anarchist unless you see me throwing bricks.</li>
        <li>Fanfiction is a good way to practice writing in a low-risk 
        environment and we should encourage it.</li>
        <li>The revolution is not something that will just happen, it's a 
        constant process that is ever-evolving.</li>
        <li>Alternate history is good.</li>
        <li>"Judeo-Christian" is a nonsense term made up by evangelical
        christians to form a false alliance with jews in their support for
        Israel as a prerequisite for the apocalypse.  Do not use it in my
        presence.</li>
        <li>C and Lua are the best low level and high level languages,
        respectively.  This is an opinion, but it is the correct one.  If 
        you use C++ or Java, your opinion doesn't count.  If you use python,
        your opinion still doesn't count, go use something that isn't slow as
        molasses in winter.</li>
